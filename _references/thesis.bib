  abstract = {In this paper, we present a tensor MIMO-GFDM system model that is based on the double contraction operator. Based on the derived system model, we propose an iterative tensor based MIMO-GFDM receiver, that is initialized with the channel estimation obtained via pilots transmitted in the first data frame. The proposed algorithm exploits the tensor structure by using several unfoldings of the received signal sequentially to obtain estimates of the transmitted symbols and the channel. Simulation results show the tensor gain for the proposed algorithm in addition to the improved channel estimation. Numerical results confirm that the receiver requires the same amount of pilots as the Zero Forcing (ZF) receiver, while having a better symbol error rate (SER) performance and a better channel estimation accuracy.},

Additionally, a closed-form expression is provided for the cases of a single source. This report includes the main parts of the derivation. For the simulation results, we compare the analytical performance with the empirical one that is based on Monte-Carlo trials. We also compare the performance of the DFT beamspace with element space version of the ESPRIT algorithm and reveal the benefits of the former. In conclusion, we discuss possible extensions for follow-up investigations.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we present an analytical performance assessment of 2-D Tensor ESPRIT in terms of physical parameters. We show that the error in the r-mode depends only on two components, irrespective of the dimensionality of the problem. We obtain analytical expressions in closed form for the mean squared error (MSE) in each dimension as a function of the signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio, the array steering matrices, the number of antennas, the number of snapshots, the selection matrices, and the signal correlation. The derived expressions allow a better understanding of the difference in performance between the tensor and the matrix versions of the ESPRIT algorithm. The simulation results confirm the coincidence between the presented analytical expression and the curves obtained via Monte Carlo trials. We analyze the behavior of each of the two error components in different scenarios.},

  abstract = {In this work we propose a gridless channel estimation scheme for MIMO systems in the millimeter wave (mmWave) band which is based on R-D Unitary Tensor-ESPRIT in DFT beamspace. Compared to conventional ESPRIT based algorithms in element space, the beamspace approach can be applied to MIMO systems with hybrid architectures. Moreover, the proposed scheme can significantly reduce the training overhead for communication systems operating in the mmWave band. The proposed algorithm involves coarse and fine estimation steps. During the coarse estimation step, Unitary Tensor-ESPRIT in elementspace is applied to the array with a reduced size aperture to obtain initial information about the angular profiles, such as directions of arrival (DoAs), directions of departure (DoDs), and propagation delays. Based on these estimates, in a second step the fine estimation of angular profiles, propagation delays and channel gains is performed applying 3-D Unitary Tensor-ESPRIT in DFT beamspace. We explain how to combine received signals from different sectors of interest (SoIs) and to perform joint processing. Simulation results show the tensor gain for the proposed algorithm in addition to the improved channel estimation.},

First, we derive the R -dimensional (R -D) Standard/Unitary Tensor-ESPRIT in DFT beamspace framework and its analytic performance. We show that ESPRIT-type algorithms in a reduced-dimensional DFT beamspace can provide a significant performance gain over ESPRIT-type algorithms in full DFT beamspace and in element space under mild conditions. Afterwards, we develop a gridless channel estimation algorithm that is based on 3-D Tensor-ESPRIT in DFT beamspace algorithms. Numerical simulation results show that the proposed channel estimation algorithm can provide accurate channel estimates using only a few training resources.},
